## Introduction

A major challenge for the real-world application of offline RL stems from the robustness against state observation perturbations, *e.g.*, as a result of sensor errors or adversarial attacks. Unlike online robust RL, agents cannot be adversarially trained in the offline setting.

Our proposed Diffusion Model-Based Predictor (DMBP) is a new framework that recovers the actual states with conditional diffusion models for state-based RL tasks. Our derived non-Markovian training objective reduces the **error accumulations**, which are commonly observed for model-based methods in state-based RL tasks.

Follow we present the visualization of the denoising effect of DMBP with Diffusion QL (trained on hopper-medium-replay-v2). The observation is perturbed with Gaussian distributed random noise with std of 0.10.

## Requirement
Our experiment is performed on D4RL benchmark environments and datasets ([click here](https://sites.google.com/view/d4rl-anonymous/)).
Please install the Mujoco Version 2.1 
([click here](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco/releases)) before getting start. See `requirements.txt` for detailed environment set up.  

## Training
### Baseline Algorithms Training
Before training DMBP, train a baseline offline RL algorithm at first:
```bash
python -m scripts.train_baseline --algo [ALGORITHM_NAME] --env_name [ENV_NAME] --dataset [DATASET_NAME]
```
### DMBP Training
DMBP utilizes the trajectory datasets for training. Download the datasets of the corresponding domain through
```bash
python -m scripts.download_datasets --domain [DOMAIN_NAME]
```
Then DMBP can be trained through:
```bash
python -m scripts.train_DMBP --task [TASK_NAME] --algo [ALGORITHM_NAME] --env_name [ENV_NAME] --dataset [DATASET_NAME]
```
where the previously trained baseline algorithms are only used for training-process evaluation.

## Evaluation
### Robustness against noised state observations
To evaluate the baseline algorithm against different attacks on state observations, run:
```bash
python -m evaluations.eval_baseline_noise --noise_type [ATTACK_METHOD] --algo [ALGORITHM_NAME] --env_name [ENV_NAME] --dataset [DATASET_NAME]
```
Then, the evaluation on the corresponding baseline algorithm strengthed by DMBP can be conducted through:
```bash
python -m evaluations.eval_DMBP_noise --noise_type [ATTACK_METHOD] --algo [ALGORITHM_NAME] --env_name [ENV_NAME] --dataset [DATASET_NAME]
```
### Robustness against incomplete state observations with unobserved dimensions
Similarly, to evaluate the baseline algorithm against incomplete state observations, run:
```bash
python -m evaluations.eval_baseline_mask --mask_dim [MASKED_DIM] --algo [ALGORITHM_NAME] --env_name [ENV_NAME] --dataset [DATASET_NAME]
```
Then, the evaluation on DMBP strenghted baseline algorithm can be conducted through:
```bash
python -m evaluations.eval_DMBP_mask --mask_dim [MASKED_DIM] --algo [ALGORITHM_NAME] --env_name [ENV_NAME] --dataset [DATASET_NAME]
```
